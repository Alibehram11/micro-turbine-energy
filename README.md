# 💧 Energy Generation in Wastewater Pipelines Using Micro Turbines  

---

## 🌍 English Summary

### 🎯 Project Goal
This project demonstrates a **micro-hydropower energy system** designed for **wastewater pipelines**.  
It simulates the process of converting the **kinetic energy of flowing wastewater** into **electrical energy** using micro turbines.

The main objectives are:
- Reduce energy waste in sewage systems  
- Generate electricity from existing wastewater flow  
- Decrease pipeline erosion through controlled hydraulic dynamics  

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Streamlit** → Web interface for interactive simulation  
- **Matplotlib** → Graph visualization and plotting  

---

### 🧮 Formula
\[
P = \rho \times g \times Q \times h \times \eta
\]

Where:  
- ρ = Water density (1000 kg/m³)  
- g = Gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²)  
- Q = Flow rate (m³/s)  
- h = Head difference (m)  
- η = Efficiency  

---

### ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
  pip install streamlit matplotlib

### Features

-Adjustable input values for flow rate, head, and efficiency
-Real-time graph of Flow Rate vs Power Output
-Automatic calculation of turbine power (in kW)
-Clean, minimalist user interface
-Educational visualization for renewable energy applications
